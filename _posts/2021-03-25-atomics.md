To start, this topic seems to often be poorly misunderstood, never understood, or hard to reason about even after understanding. I can firmly say here that I don't really know what im talking about. This is just how I understand these things. Take of it what you will.

## Atomics and Background

Lets get some definitions out of the way: 

* Parallelism is things happening at the same time (i.e. two people, each doing their own task). 
* Concurrency is multiple things happening, but not necessarily at the same time (i.e. one person switching between tasks)
* Atomicity is something appearing to happen in its entirety, with no observable partial states. (i.e. I appear to have written this blog atomically if you don't look at my commits)
