# Hey
I'm another programmer who likes optimization and resource efficiency.
Currently a shill for anything fast/clever execution wise and will remain as such for the time being.
This is a personal blog post: it's bound to have opinions, inaccurancies, tpyos, and occasionally insight.
Feel free to send a PR/issue for corrections/discussions, although there's no guarantee that i'll see, respond or address it.
